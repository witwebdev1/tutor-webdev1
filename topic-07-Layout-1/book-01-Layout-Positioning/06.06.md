#Managing Collapsed Parent elements

In this <a href="archives/examples/clear3.htm" target="_blank">example</a>, the parent element is not visible at all! You should have been able to see it because of the gray background color, but instead, the three floating elements just sit there as if they had no parent.

~~~
.parent {
        background-color: Gainsboro;
}

.child {
        float: left;
        margin: 10px;
        background-color: CornflowerBlue;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        padding: 5px;
}
...
<div class="parent">
        <div class="child">Box</div>
        <div class="child">Box</div>
        <div class="child">Box</div>
</div>
~~~

Why? Because floating elements does not reserve any space in its parent element and since there are only floating element inside the parent div, it collapses as if it was empty. If you add a word below the three child divs, you will actually be able to see the parent element, but it now only reserves space for this word (the only non-floating element), meaning that the parent will only be as high as a single line of text, with the three boxes hanging out of the bottom.

##Solutions

There are 2 possible solutions.

###Solution 1

In this <a href="archives/examples/clear4.htm" target="_blank">solution</a>, by clearing all floats before the end of the container, the browser is forced to reserve space inside of it right down to the clearing element.

Notice how we just added the empty clearing div at the bottom of the parent element to fix this problem. It simply uses the CSS clear property to clear floats from both directions.

~~~
.parent {
        background-color: Gainsboro;
}

.child {
        float: left;
        margin: 10px;
        background-color: CornflowerBlue;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        padding: 5px;
}

.clear {
        clear: both;
}
...
<div class="parent">
        <div class="child">Box</div>
        <div class="child">Box</div>
        <div class="child">Box</div>
        <div class="clear"></div>
</div>
~~~


###Solution 2

In this <a href="archives/examples/clear5.htm" target="_blank">solution</a>, we add the overflow property (with its value set to auto) to the containing element (in this example, the div that has the parent class applied).

~~~
.parent {
        background-color: Gainsboro;
        overflow:auto;
}

.child {
        float: left;
        margin: 10px;
        background-color: CornflowerBlue;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        padding: 5px;
}
...
<div class="parent">
        <div class="child">Box</div>
        <div class="child">Box</div>
        <div class="child">Box</div>
</div>
