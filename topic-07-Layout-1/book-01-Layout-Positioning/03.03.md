#Overlapping Elements

When elements are positioned outside the normal flow, they can overlap other elements as illustrated in the following <a href="archives/examples/overlap.htm" target="_blank">example</a>.

Here is the code:
~~~
.box {
        position: absolute;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
}
...
<div class="box" style="background-color: #5f8426;">Box 1</div>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #6495ed;">Box 2</div>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #68968a;">Box 3</div>
~~~

We can only see see box number 3. Why? Because they all have the same positions (default values for top and left), so the last declared element takes precedence and is placed on top of the other. 

##The z-index property

This might not be what you want though and as luck would have it, CSS has a property for controlling this: The z-index property. 

Look at the changes in this code:

~~~
.box {
        position: absolute;
        width: 80px;
        height: 80px;
        padding: 10px;
}
...
<div class="box" style="background-color: #5f8426; top: 10px; left: 10px; z-index: 3;">Box 1</div>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #6495ed; top: 60px; left: 60px; z-index: 1;">Box 2</div>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #68968a; top: 100px; left: 100px; z-index: 2;">Box 3</div>
~~~

With the z-index property, we take full control of which elements are on top. It holds a numeric value, which defaults to 0, and the higher z-index value an element has, the more on top it will be, as illustrated by this <a href="archives/examples/overlap2.htm" target="_blank">example</a>.
