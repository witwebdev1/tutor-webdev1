In these exercises, we are working with HTML Tables (creation and styling). For this you need to download [Lab01](archives/Lab01.zip). 

Remember to download the zipped file into your Week4 folder in your Website Development 1 folder.

-  The tables, table headings, and table data have a border as follows:  solid black 1px.  
-  The table headings and table data have padding (top and bottom) of 0.1em, and (left and right) 1em (i.e: padding: 0.1em 1em;)  
-  The cells that display the animal categories (Cats,  Dogs,  Lemurs)  are table headings (th). All other cells are table data (td).
