# Floating

A very powerful positioning technique is floating. It allows you to take a block level element out of the normal order and let other elements float around it. You can float to the left or right. Let's look at some examples:

This example illustrates a navigation area floated to the left: <a href="archives/examples/floated1.htm" target="_blank">Float Left Example</a>

```css
nav {
  float: left;
  width: 300px;
  background-color: yellow;
}
```


The next example illustrates a floated navigation area to the right: <a href="archives/examples/floated2.htm" target="_blank">Float Right Example</a>

```css
nav {
  float: right;
  width: 300px;
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

**Note:** Elements to be floated must be specified/coded first in your HTML code - like the `<nav>` element in the examples above.


To improve the the look of navigation and content areas, we could add a margin for our content area: This <a href="archives/examples/floated3.htm" target="_blank">example</a> illustrates a navigation area floated to the left; the content area is beside the navigation area.

```css
nav {
  float: left;
  width: 20%;
  background-color: yellow;
}

.contentconstrained {
  margin-left:23%;
}
```


## Floating Elements Next to Each Other

If you place several floating elements after each other, they will float next to each other if there is room. Here we have made an image gallery using the float property:

```css
.thumbnail {
  float:left;
  width:110px;
  height:90px;
  margin:5px;
}
```

## Floats and "clear"

When you start floating your elements, you will very likely soon run into a common problem: When you have a floating element, all content after it will move up next to it, if there's enough space.

In this <a href="archives/examples/clear1.htm" target="_blank">example</a>, we want the footer element to take up all the space after the image of the text, but because the text doesn't take up enough room, the footer is moved up right below the text and then partly overlapped by the image.

```css
.container {
        width: 300px;
        background-color: Gainsboro;
        padding: 10px;
        text-align: justify;
}

.image {
        float: left;
        margin: 0 10px 10px 0;
}

.footer {
        background-color: Azure;
        text-align: center;
}
```
```html
<div class="container">
        <img src="http://www.css3-tutorial.net/images/logo.png" class="image">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed auctor placerat metus,
        sit amet egestas dui rutrum sed.
        <div class="footer">Footer</div>
</div>
```


The solution to this problem comes from the **clear** property. It's specifically designed to clear existing floats, so that elements are once again laid out like you would expect from HTML and CSS.

The clear property takes one of three different values: **left**, **right**, or **both**. This tells the browser if you want to clear only floats from the left or the right or if you want to clear floats from both directions.

In this <a href="archives/examples/clear2.htm" target="_blank">example</a>, we utilise the clear property right before the content which you want to stay away from the floated content. In this case, we can simply apply it to the footer element, because it holds the content that we want out of the floated area.

```css
.container {
        width: 300px;
        background-color: Gainsboro;
        padding: 10px;
        text-align: justify;
}

.image {
        float: left;
        margin: 0 10px 10px 0;
}

.footer {
        background-color: Azure;
        text-align: center;
        clear:both;
}
```
```html
<div class="container">
        <img src="http://www.css3-tutorial.net/images/logo.png" class="image">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed auctor placerat metus,
        sit amet egestas dui rutrum sed.
        <div class="footer">Footer</div>
</div>
```
