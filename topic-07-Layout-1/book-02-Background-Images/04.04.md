# Other background properties

## Background Position

The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. The background-position property requires two values: the vertical position (top, center, or bottom) and the horizontal position (left, center, or right).

Remember the following example?

```css
#palmtree {
      border:1px solid black;
      background-color: white;
      background-image: url(../images/palm-trees.jpg);
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-position:top right;
      padding:.3em 13em .3em 1em;
}
```

This <a href="archives/examples/bgimage5.htm" target="_blank">example</a> showed a palm tree image which was fixed at the top right of the page.


## Background Attachment

The background-attachment property sets whether a background image is fixed or scrolls with the rest of the page. The values are **scroll** or **fixed**.

This <a href="archives/examples/fixedattachment.htm" target="_blank">example</a> shows the image chrome.gif fixed on the page even if the user needs to scroll.

```css
body
{
background-image:url('../images/chrome.gif');
background-repeat:no-repeat;
background-attachment:fixed;
}
```


## Shorthand Backgrounds

We can also set the color, image, etc. using the background shorthand property.

For example, here you can see the background colour is set to white, a background image is added, no-repeat is specified, and a position is given: all in one go. Values should be separated by spaces.

```css
#palmtree {
      border:1px solid black;
      background: white url(../images/palm-trees.jpg)
                  no-repeat top right;
      padding:.3em 13em .3em 1em;
}
```
