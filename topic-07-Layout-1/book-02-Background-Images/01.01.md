# Column Span
There will be times that you need a data to span two or more columns.  To accomplish this use the **colspan=#** command 
within the **&lt;th&gt;** or **&lt;td&gt;** tags as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/example5.htm" target="_blank">Column Span Example</a>:

~~~
<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4">heading</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">under 123</td>
    <td>under 4 </td>
  </tr>
</table>
~~~

The total number of cells has to be the same in all rows, where any cells that span *n* columns are counted as *n* cells.
