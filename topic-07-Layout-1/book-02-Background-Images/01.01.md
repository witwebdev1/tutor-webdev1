#Adding a background image

Images can be used as decorative backgrounds for your webpages. When you add a background image, you should also add a background colour also that complements the image colour (and be used if the image doesn't appear, for some reason).

To add a background image you need to specify the file name, and its relative location. 

**Note** the ../ in the image path below, before images/clouds.jpg; this is very important to include. It tells the browser how to get from your css folder, where this CSS code is, to the images folder where the background image is stored. Using "../" tells the browser to go up a folder to the main website folder; "images/" tells it to go into the images folder; and, lastly, "clouds.jpg" tells it to look for that image file.

body {
      background-image: url(../images/clouds.jpg);
	  background-color: lightblue;
}

There are several other properties that you can set for background images, including:

- background-repeat 
- background-size 
- background-position
- background-attachment

We will now discuss each of these properties.
