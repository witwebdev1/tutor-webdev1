#Background gradients

CSS3 gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

Earlier, you had to use images for these effects. However, by using CSS3 gradients you can reduce download time and bandwidth usage. In addition, elements with gradients look better when zoomed, because the gradient is generated by the browser.

CSS3 defines two types of gradients:

- Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
- Radial Gradients (defined by their center)

##Linear Gradients

Syntax: *background: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);*

Linear gradients create a smooth blend of colour in a linear direction. We can specify the direction of the gradient and the colours that are part of the blend. We need to specify at least two colours, and can use more than two if we wish. Colours can be specified using the colour name or the hexadecimal colour code. **Note:** We should also provide a background-color as some older browsers may not support the linear-gradient property.

Here are <a href="archives/examples/gradient1.html" target="_blank">some examples</a> of linear gradients.

###Example 1

This gradient is red to yellow. Note that when we don't specify a direction, it uses the default: top to bottom.
~~~
#grad1 {
    height: 200px;
    background-color: red; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: linear-gradient(red, yellow); 
}
...
<h3>Linear Gradient - Top to Bottom</h3>
<p>This linear gradient starts at the top. It starts red, transitioning to yellow.</p>

<div id="grad1"></div>
~~~


###Example 2

This gradient is blue to green. We have also specified "to right", which means the gradient will go from left to right.
~~~
#grad2 {
    height: 200px;
    background-color: blue; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: linear-gradient(to right, blue, green); 
}
...
<h3>Linear Gradient - Left to Right</h3>
<p>This linear gradient starts at the left and goes to the right. It starts blue, transitioning to green.</p>

<div id="grad2"></div>
~~~


###Example 3

This gradient is rainbow-coloured. We can specify as many colours as we want in a gradient; just separate them with commas. We have also specified "to bottom right", which means the gradient will go from the top-left to the bottom-right.
~~~
#grad3 {
    height: 200px;
    background-color: green; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet); 
}
...
<h3>Linear Gradient - Top left to Bottom right</h3>
<p>This linear gradient starts at the top left and goes towards the bottom right. It has multiple colour stops: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet - all the colours of the rainbow!</p>

<div id="grad3"></div>
~~~


##Radial Gradients

Syntax: *background: radial-gradient(shape, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);*

Radial gradients create a smooth blend of colour in a elliptical or circular shape, from the centre outwards. We can specify the shape that should be used: ellipse (which is the default) and circle. We need to specify at least two colours and, as with linear gradients, we can use more than two if we wish. **Note:** Don't forget to include a background-color for older browsers that don't support the gradient property.

Here are <a href="archives/examples/gradient2.html" target="_blank">some examples</a> of radial gradients.

###Example 1

This gradient is red to yellow. It uses the default shape of an ellipse.
~~~
#grad1 {
    height: 200px;
    background-color: red; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: radial-gradient(red, yellow); 
}
...
<h3>Radial Gradient - Ellipse</h3>
<p>This radial gradient uses the default shape: an ellipse. It starts red in the centre, transitioning outwards to yellow.</p>

<div id="grad1"></div>
~~~


###Example 2

This gradient is blue to green. We have also specified circle as the shape for the gradient.
~~~
#grad2 {
    height: 200px;
    background-color: blue; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: radial-gradient(circle, blue, green); 
}
...
<h3>Radial Gradient - Circle</h3>
<p>This radial gradient uses the circle shape. It starts blue, transitioning outwards to green.</p>

<div id="grad2"></div>
~~~


###Example 3

This gradient is rainbow-coloured and uses the circle shape. As we saw with the linear gradient, we can use multiple colours by separating them with commas. 
~~~
#grad3 {
    height: 200px;
    background-color: green; /* For browsers that do not support gradients */
    background: radial-gradient(circle, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet); 
}

...
<h3>Radial Gradient - Circle, multiple colours</h3>
<p>This radial gradient also uses the circle shape. It has multiple colour stops: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet - all the colours of the rainbow!</p>

<div id="grad3"></div>
