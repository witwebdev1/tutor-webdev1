We want to stripe every other row of the table with a different colour, and the easiest way to do that is to find every **even** row of the table and give it a background colour. We then
do the same thing with every **odd** row. CSS3 has ***even*** and ***odd*** keywords that support this exact situation as in the 
following <a href = "archives/Class Htmls/rowstyle.htm" target="_blank">(Even and Odd rows coloured) example</a>.

~~~
tbody tr:nth-of-type(odd) {
  background-color: #ddd;
}

tbody tr:nth-of-type(even) {
  background-color: #f3f3f3;
}
~~~

So, the first selector says "Find me every odd table row in the table body and give it a background colour". The second selector says "Find me every even table row in the table body give it a background colour too".</p>


The ***first-of-type***  or ***last-of-type*** selectors can be used to select the first (or last) row using ***tr:first-of-type***
or  ***tr:last-of-type*** respectively. 

Likewise we can use them as follows to select the
first (or last) column using ***td:first-of-type*** or  ***td:last-of-type*** respectively as in the following 
<a href = "archives/Class Htmls/rowstyle1.htm" target="_blank">(First Column bolded) example</a>.

To further enhance the rows, we could add the ***:hover*** pseudoclass to change the background colour and/or font colour when the mouse moves over the table to highlight the 
current row as in the following <a href = "archives/Class Htmls/rowstyle2.htm" target="_blank">(Use of hover) example</a>.

~~~
tbody tr:hover {
  cursor:pointer;
  background-color: gray;
  color: white;
}
