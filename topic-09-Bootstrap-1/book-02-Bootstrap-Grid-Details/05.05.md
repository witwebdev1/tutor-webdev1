# Ordering Columns

Bootstrap 4 flexbox has a built-in **order** property. We can use a number system where **0** is the default and 
means flex-unordered, **1** has greater order and **2** is greater
again as illustrated in the following <a href = "archives/class htmls/ex6.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

~~~
<div class="row">
        <div class="col order-2">1st in markup <br> Last in layout</div>
        <div class="col order-1">2nd in markup <br> 2nd in layout </div>
        <div class="col order-0">3rd in markup <br> First in layout </div>
</div>

<!-- The way Bootstrap has implemented it is via three ordering classes:

- .flex-first - Displayed first.
- .flex-last - Displayed last.
- .flex-unordered - Displayed between first and last.
