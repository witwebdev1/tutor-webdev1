#Column Wrapping

When the sum of all columns in a row is over 12, the first extra column will move to the next line. This is known as column wrapping.
In the following <a href="archives/class htmls/ex7.html" target="_blank">example</a>, we can see the third column moves to the next row.
~~~
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6</div>
   <div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6</div>
   <div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6, This column will move to the next line.</div>
</div>
~~~

The only thing to note here is that when using the auto layout, a sizeless column that took up only a couple of spaces, can take up the entire row 
once it wraps as in the following <a href="archives/class htmls/ex7a.html" target="_blank">example</a>.
~~~
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6</div>
   <div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6</div>
   <div class="col-md">.col-md, This column will move to the next line and take up the full column.</div>
</div>
