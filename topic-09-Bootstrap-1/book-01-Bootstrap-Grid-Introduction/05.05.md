#Using the Grid System

Recall that this is how the Bootstrap grid system works:

- Rows must be placed within a container for proper alignment and padding.
- Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.
- Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
- Predefined grid classes like **.row** and **.col-sm-4** are available for quickly making grid layouts.
- Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows.
- Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span.

## Example One
In the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex3.html" target="_ blank">example</a>, we have 3 columns of data on the web page. Firstly, there is a container class which has a default
width (and which we will customise). Then there are a row of siblings. In our case, there are three div elements that are
contained inside a single row. So we start a new row by adding a new div with class row. The row now has three more div tags with
the class **col-md-4**. The number 4 in the class tells us that it occupies four grids.
So three sibling divs with four grids each will occupy 12 grids, which is perfectly fine.
~~~
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-4">
     <h2>Frontend</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
     <h2>Serverside</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
     <h2>Databases</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
</div>
~~~

A feature of the Bootstrap 4 grid is the **auto-layout** mode. It lets developers leave out the size of columns,
making them automatically distribute the space in that row. Sizeless columns share the available space equally, always filling up the entire row.

Because the 3 column widths are the same you can leave out the number and just use **col-md** and Bootstrap will determine you want 3 columns of equal size (**4**)
as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex3c.html" target="_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md">
     <h2>Frontend</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md">
     <h2>Serverside</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md">
     <h2>Databases</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
</div>
~~~
<a href="archives/Class Htmls/grid1.html" target="_ blank">Example One </a> and <a href="archives/Class Htmls/grid2.html" target="_blank">Example Two </a>
are further examples of using **auto-layout**. View the source of each of the pages to see the column sizes.

## Example Two
You can also create equal-width columns that span multiple rows by inserting a **.w-100** where you want the columns to break to a new line as in the
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/grid4.html" target="_ blank">example</a>.
~~~
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md">col</div>
  <div class="col-md">col</div>
  <div class="w-100"></div>
  <div class="col-md">col</div>
  <div class="col-md">col</div>
  <div class="w-100"></div>
  <div class="col-md">col</div>
  <div class="col-md">col</div>
</div>

~~~

## Example Three
If we want a column to be bigger or smaller than the other columns in a row, we can do that with a **.col-md-size** class. In this <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex3a.html" target="_ blank">example</a>, we again have 3 columns of data but each has a different size.
~~~
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-3">
     <h2>Frontend</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
     <h2>Serverside</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md-5">
     <h2>Databases</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
</div>
~~~

You could leave the size out of one of the column width specifications and the browser would determine its size based on the total adding
up to 12.

~~~
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-3">
     <h2>Frontend</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
     <h2>Serverside</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md">
     <h2>Databases</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>
</div>
