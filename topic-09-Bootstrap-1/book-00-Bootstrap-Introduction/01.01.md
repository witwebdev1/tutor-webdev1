# What is Bootstrap 4?

Bootstrap is a free and open-source framework for creating websites and web applications. It's the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

As the web evolves more and more toward responsive design, it can be a real challenge for web developers to keep up. Bootstrap can make things a whole lot easier. Bootstrap enables you to create responsive websites without you needing to do the "responsive" bit. Bootstrap takes care of that.

## One Framework, Every Device

Bootstrap is promoted as being One framework, every device. This is because websites built with Bootstrap will automatically scale between devices \- whether the device is a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, screen reader, etc.

## Mobile-First

Not only is Bootstrap responsive, it is mobile-first. This means that it is primarily designed for mobile devices, then scales up from there (as opposed to being designed for desktop, then trying to scale it down to mobile devices).

##Bootstrap Components

Bootstap includes components such as buttons, navbars, dropdown menus, alert boxes, and more. In most cases, you can make use of a component simply by using the appropriate class name.

We'll be looking at these components in the next tutorial.
