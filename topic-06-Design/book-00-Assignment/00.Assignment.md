#Assignment One

The purpose of the assignment is to build a Web site using text, links, graphics, and CSS formatting. All formatting must be done with CSS styles (inside an external CSS file).

Incorporate as many of the techniques we covered up to this point in the module. The objective of this project is to demonstrate all of the techniques we have covered that you have mastered (all the types of formatting, content, links, tables, etc.).

Make sure your files validate at: 

- <a href="http://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">`http://validator.w3.org`</a> (for HTML) 
- <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator" target="_blank">`http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator`</a> (for CSS) 

This assignment is worth 30% of your grade for this module.
