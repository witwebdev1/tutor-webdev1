#Adding a Border
The &lt;table&gt; element can have a **border** attribute that is supported in all major browsers. The **border**
attribute specifies if a border should be displayed around the table cells or not.

You can leave out the **border** attribute and style the border in the .CSS file.
You will need to add a border property for the &lt;table&gt; element, &lt;th&gt; element, and &lt;td&gt; element if you wish
all elements to have a border as seen in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/simpletable2.htm" target="_blank">example</a>:

~~~
table, th, td {
  border: solid navy 2px;
}
~~~

Or if you only want (say) the &lt;table&gt; element to have a border only (and not the other elements), then you only need to add the 
border property for the table selector only.

~~~
table {
  border: solid navy 2px;
}
~~~
