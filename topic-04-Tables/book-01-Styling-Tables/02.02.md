# Caption Alignment
We will now adjust the caption alignment. We can use **caption-side** property to align the
caption to either the top (default value) or bottom as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/example3.htm" target="_blank">example</a>:

~~~
caption {
  caption-side:bottom;
}
~~~

Remember, the default caption alignment is top and center. We can also align the text to the left or right using *text-align* property 
in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/example4.htm" target="_blank">example</a>:
~~~
caption {
  caption-side:bottom;
  text-align:left;
}
~~~
