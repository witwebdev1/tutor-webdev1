# Descendant Selector Exercise 1:

1. Open *index.html*.
2. In the style section, add a style rule that will capitalize the first letter of each word if the strong tag is a descendant of the blockquote tag.
3. In the style section, add a style rule that will change the font colour to red if the em tag is a descendant of the blockquote tag.
4. In the style section, add a style rule that will add an underline and overline if the em tag is a descendant of the strong tag and the strong tag is a descendant of the blockquote tag.

# Descendant Selector Exercise 2:
