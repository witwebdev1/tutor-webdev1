# Adjacent Sibling Selector

We have just looked at the sibling selector, which allows us to select all elements which 
follows another element within the same parent. However, using the Adjacent sibling selector, 
you can limit this to only include the first element which comes directly after the first 
element in the markup.

~~~
<style>
h2 + p {
        font-style: italic;
}
</style>
...
 <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
 <p>Some text here</p>
 <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
 <p>Some text here</p>
 <p>More text here</p>
 <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
 <p>Text here as well...</p>
 <p>But no more!</p>

In this <a href = "archives/Class Htmls/desc5.htm" target = "_blank">Example</a>, with the adjacent sibling selector, we have just specified that the first paragraph element after all H2 elements should use italic text.

The syntax for the adjacent sibling selector is - the two selector parts are simply joined by a plus character (+).
