# Child Selector

A descendant doesn't need to be the direct child

With this selector type, you should be aware that not only direct children are targeted - also children of the child (grandchildren) and so on will be targeted, all the way down through the hierarchy.

div.highlighted b {
        color: blue;
}
...
<div class="highlighted">
        <b>Level 0...</b>
        <div>
                <b>Level 1...</b>
                <div>
                        <b>Level 2...</b>
                </div>
        </div>
</div>

In this <a href = "archives/Class Htmls/desc2.htm" target = "_blank">Example</a>, we target bold elements which are descendants of a div tag with the class "highlighted". If you try the example, you will notice that even though we wrap the last set of bold tags in several layers of div tags, it is still affected by the rule about blue bold tags.

We have seen just how powerful the descendant selector can be, because it allows you to target ALL children and grandchildren (and so on) of one or several elements. However, sometimes this can be TOO powerful - sometimes you only want to target the direct children of an element. Fortunately for us, CSS has a selector for this as well!
The syntax for using the direct child selector looks like this:
~~~
parent > child
~~~

~~~
<style>
div.highlighted > b {
        color: blue;
}
</style>
~~~
In this <a href = "archives/Class Htmls/desc3.htm" target = "_blank">Example</a>, only direct children of the parent are now affected.
