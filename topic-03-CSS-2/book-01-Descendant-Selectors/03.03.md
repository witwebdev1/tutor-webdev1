#Sibling Selector
What if you want to target siblings instead? CSS has a couple of selector types for that as well, here we'll check out the general sibling selector.

With the general sibling CSS selector, which takes a selector, followed by a tilde character (~) and then the selector you wish to target, you can target elements by requiring the presence of another element within the same parent element. Another requirement is that the first part of the selector needs to be present in the markup BEFORE the targeted element, even though they are all children of the same parent.

~~~
<style>
h2 ~ p {
        font-style: italic;
}
</style>
...
 <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
 <p>Some text here</p>
 <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
 <p>Some text here</p>
 <p>More text here</p>
~~~

In this <a href = "archives/Class Htmls/desc4.htm" target = "_blank">Example</a>, all of 
the text elements are children of the same element (body). We then specify that 
paragraph elements which are siblings to an H2 element should be in the `italic` style. 
As you can see,  this means that the last two paragraph tags will be in italic, but not t
he first, because it comes before the H2 element in the markup.
