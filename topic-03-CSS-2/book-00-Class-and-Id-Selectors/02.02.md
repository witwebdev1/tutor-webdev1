# Id Selectors

The id selector is used to specify a style for a **single, unique** element.
The id selector uses the *id* attribute of the HTML element, and is defined with a "#" (hash symbol). The #id selector styles the element with the specified id. For example when we have a style rule as follows:
~~~
#firstname {
   background-color:yellow;
}
~~~

This rule selects the element with id="firstname" and styles the background colour to yellow.

To use/apply the id selector to a web page element, use
~~~
<p id = "firstname">
~~~
This applies a yellow background colour to the paragraph with the id selector equal to *firstname* as in the following
