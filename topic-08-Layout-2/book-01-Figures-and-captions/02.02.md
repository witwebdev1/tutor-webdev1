# Example

In this <a href="archives/bubbleunder/gallery.htm" target="_ blank">example</a>, you can see an image gallery has been added to the Bubble Under site. This example makes use of the figure and figcaption elements.

The HTML for the figures, images and captions looks like this:
```html
<figure>
  <img src="gallery/turtle-bite.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="A turtle swims comfortably among the coral, despite its old injury - a large shark bite on one side" class="border">
  <figcaption>This turtle was spotted swimming around the Great Barrier Reef (Queensland, Australia) quite gracefully despite having had a large chunk taken out of its right side, presumably in a shark attack.<br>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="gallery/jellyfish.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="A jellyfish flanked by smaller fish" class = "border">
  <figcaption>Jill was just snorkelling when she took this picture - the jellyfish was only a couple of feet under the surface, hence the light is excellent. Jill assures us that the jellyfish hadno "nasty, stingy, dangly bits"! <br>
  <span>[Photographer: Jill Smith]</span>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="gallery/turtle-face.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="A close-up, straight-on shot of a turtle feeding on the
  coral" class = "border">
  <figcaption>"I was right next to him as he bit chunks of coral off for dinner - what a sound!" So describes club member Paul who took this shot in Fiji.<br>
    <span>[Photographer: Paul Spencer]</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="gallery/what-a-star.jpg" width="400" height="318" alt="Black and white patterned starfish" class = "border">
  <figcaption>You're a star - and don't let anyone tell you any different!<br>
    <span> [Photographer: Helen Cranfield]</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="gallery/reef2.jpg" width="400" height="285" alt="Another beautiful example of the Great Barrier Reef" class = "border">
  <figcaption>Another cracking shot of the reef from Mark.<br>
    <span>[Photographer: Mark Williams]</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

The CSS for the figure, images, figcaption, and span inside the figcaption looks as follows:

```css
img.border {
  border: 15px solid white;
}

figure {
  border-bottom: 1px solid navy;
  margin-bottom: 2%;
}

figcaption {
  color:navy;
  font-size: 75%;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-top: 0;
  width: 70%;
  line-height: 1.4em;
}

figcaption span {
  font-weight: normal;
  color: gray;
}
```
