## Adding an Image

As we have seen previously, to add an image to a web page we use the `<img>` tag. For Example:

```html
<img src="images/atitlan.jpg" alt="Lake Atitlan, Guatemala" width="300" height="240">
```

## Figure and Figcaption

HTML5 introduces two elements that work in tandem to add captions and other text details to diagrams, illustrations, photos, code examples, and pretty much any other visual element that you can think of.

The `<figure>` element encloses both the image and caption, if you include one. The `<figcaption>` element is optional, so you can have an image without one. Only one `<figcaption>` element may be nested within a `<figure>`, although the `<figure>` element itself may contain other child elements, such as `<img>` or `<code>`, and can appear before or after the content within the `<figure>`.

This <a href="archives/examples/caption.htm" target="_ blank">example</a> illustrates an image with a caption.
