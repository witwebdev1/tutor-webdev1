# Grouping Rows
You can group together rows and split a table into a header, footer, and body by organising rows into **thead**, **tfoot**, and **tbody** elements.

Grouping rows can also provide a handy block to latch CSS on to, for example, if you wanted to change the background colour of a block of rows in a table.

You can have one or more *tbody* elements but only one *thead* and *tfoot* elements as in the 
following <a href = "archives/Class Htmls/rowgr.htm" target="_blank">Grouping Rows Example</a>:

...
<style>
...
thead {
    background:gray;
}

tfoot{
    font-style:italic
}
...
</style>

<table summary="Interest Rates">
  <caption>Interest Rates</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Account Type</th>
      <th>Interest Rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Recommended for you: 'Young Saver'</td>
      <td>Interest from: 1.6%</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Smart</td>
      <td>From 2%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Young Saver</td>
      <td>From 1.6%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When specifying the **thead**, **tfoot**, and **tbody** elements, note that **thead** and **tfoot** are specified before any
**tbody** elements.
