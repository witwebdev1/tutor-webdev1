# Row Span
Similarly, there may be instances that you need a data to span two or
more rows.  To accomplish this use the **rowspan=#** command within the **&lt;th&gt;** or **&lt;td&gt;** tags as in the 
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/example6.htm" target="_blank">Row Span Example</a>:


~~~
<table>
  <tr><th rowspan="2">heading</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
  </tr>
</table>
~~~

You have to ensure that the cell count comes out the same for all rows (you include any cell from a previous row that spans into another row as part of that row's cell count).
