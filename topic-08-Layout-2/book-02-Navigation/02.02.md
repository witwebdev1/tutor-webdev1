## WIT Website: Adding the CSS

Add the following selectors to the .css file (mycss.css):

- All the web site content will reside in the container division; here we add a background colour, margin, and a width of 90%.
```css
#container {
 background-color:#9fB6CD;
 width:90%;
 margin:2% auto;
}
```

- The header structural element will have padding of 2em.
```css
header {
 padding:2em;
}
```

- The navigation structural element has a background colour of #616e7d.
```css
nav {
 background-color:#616e7d;
}
```

- The main structural element has padding of 0.5m (top and bottom), 2em (left and right), and the text is justified.
```css
main {
 padding:.5em 2em;
 text-align:justify;
}
```

After adding these CSS styles, your website should look as follows:
