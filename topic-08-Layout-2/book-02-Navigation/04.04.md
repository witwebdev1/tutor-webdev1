#Controlling Word Wrap Within Cells
A browser may choose to wrap the text in your table cells while it is adjusting the content to fit the column widths as in the 
following  <a href="archives/Class Htmls/nonowrap.htm" target="_blank">example</a>. 

If you find that your text is breaking between words you would rather see stay together, you can prevent the wrapping in a couple ways.

1. You can put non-breaking spaces between words that you do not want to wrap. This will force the browser to leave the column containing that text content wider, since it won't be able to break those words apart.
2. You can use the CSS **white-space:nowrap** declaration and apply it to a cell or its content (a paragraph or span, for example) to prevent wrapping of that text as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/nowrap.htm" target="_blank">example</a>:

~~~
table,th,td {
   border:solid black 2px;
}

table {
   width:60%;
   margin:0 auto;
   border-collapse:collapse;
}

.nowrap {
   white-space:nowrap;
}
...

 <tr>
  <td class="nowrap">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</td>
  <td>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</td>
</tr>
