## WIT Website: Styling the nav links

We will now add the styles for the navigation links. As you can see in the HTML files, the navigation for the site is an unordered list that contains a number of links. Add the following styles to mycss.css:

- Add padding of 0.5em to the unordered list; use nav ul to target only the unordered list in the nav section (so that any other lists on the website won't be affected by these styles)
```css
nav ul {
 padding:0.5em;
}
```

- Each list item will have a margin of 0 on the top and bottom and 2% on the left and right. The display is inline; this is the part that makes the nav links horizontal, all appearing on the same line.
```css
nav ul li {
 display:inline;
 margin:0 2%;
}
```

- The a:link and a:visited states are styled white, with no underline, the hover state is gray with a lightgray background, and the active state is yellow. Note that we use descendant selectors (e.g. nav ul li a:link) to ensure that only the navigation links are affected, and not other links on our site.
```css
nav ul li a:link, nav ul li a:visited {
 text-decoration: none;
 color: white;
}

nav ul li a:hover {
 color:gray;
 background-color:lightgray;
}

nav ul li a:active {
 color: yellow;
}
```

- Lastly, each link inside the list item uses the inline-block display type so that a width property can be applied. Background colour, padding, and text styles are also applied.
```css
nav ul li a{
 display:inline-block;
 background-color:#6C7B8B;
 width:13em;
 padding:0.5em 0;
 text-align:center;
 font-weight:bold;
 font-size:90%;
}
```

The website should now looks as follows:
