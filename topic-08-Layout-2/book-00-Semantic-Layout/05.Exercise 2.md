## Exercise Two: Tresidder Union Website

Download [lab02.zip](archives/lab02.zip) and extract it into the Week 8 folder.

Your objective for this exercise is to modify the Tresidder Union website. The website has four web pages: a home page, a food page, a retail page, and a services page. Each webpage will follow the very common left-hand sidebar, right-hand main page text design. Here’s a screenshot of the front webpage:

As you can see it consists of a left-hand navigation structural element, a header, and some information about Tresidder. The food, retail, and services web pages will list the various establishments in Tresidder.

Here’s a screenshot of the food web page:

The Retail and Services web pages should look almost exactly the same.
