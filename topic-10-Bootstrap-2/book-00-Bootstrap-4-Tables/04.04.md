# Contextual Classes

You can apply color to individual rows or cells by using Bootstrap's **contextual** classes as seen in the
following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex9.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

The 5 contextual classes are:

- .table-active,
- .table-danger,
- .table-info,
- .table-success, and
- .table-warning.
