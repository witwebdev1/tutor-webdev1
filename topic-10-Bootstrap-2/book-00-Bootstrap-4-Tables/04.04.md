# Contextual Classes

You can apply color to individual rows or cells by using Bootstrap's **contextual** classes as seen in the 
following <a href="archives/class htmls/ex9.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

The 5 contextual classes are: 

- .table-active, 
- .table-danger, 
- .table-info, 
- .table-success, and 
- .table-warning.
