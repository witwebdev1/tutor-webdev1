# Responsive Tables

Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Make any table responsive across all viewports by 
adding **.table-responsive** class on **.table**. Or, pick a maximum breakpoint with which to have a 
responsive table up to by adding **.table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}..**

To create a responsive table add the **.table-responsive** class to the **&lt;table&gt;** element as in the following
<a href="archives/class htmls/ex10.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

Our final 2 examples illustrate the usage of most of the table classes.

<a href="archives/class htmls/ex11.html" target="_blank">Example One</a> is a table utilising all of the classes, while <a href="archives/class htmls/ex12.html" target="_blank">Example Two</a>
 enhances the same table by changing the striped colour and the colour of the hover.
