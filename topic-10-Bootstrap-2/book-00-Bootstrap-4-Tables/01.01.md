# Basic Table

For a basic table with lightly padded cells and horizontal dividers, apply Bootstrap's **.table** class to the **&lt;table&gt;** element
as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex1.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

<table class="table">
  ...
</table>

## Inverse Table

You can invert the colours of the table by using the **.table-dark** class as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex2.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

~~~
<table class="table table-dark">
  ...
</table>
