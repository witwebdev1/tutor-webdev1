#Enhancing the Table
Here, we will add stripes, a border and hover effect to the table. If the table takes up too much space, it can be condensed.

## Striped Table

For alternating background colors on the rows, add Bootstrap's **.table-striped** class as in the following <a href="archives/class htmls/ex3.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

~~~
<table class="table table-striped">
  ...
</table>
~~~

## Bordered Table

For borders all around the table, use Bootstrap's **table-bordered**  class as in the following <a href="archives/class htmls/ex4.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

~~~
<table class="table table-bordered">
  ...
</table>
~~~

## Hover Rows

To achieve that "hover" effect when mousing over the table rows, use Bootstrap's **.table-hover** class as in the following <a href="archives/class htmls/ex5.html" target="_blank">example</a>.

~~~
<table class="table table-hover">
  ...
</table>
~~~


## Small/Condensed Table

If you find a table has too much padding, you can half the padding by using Bootstrap's **.table-sm** class as in the 
following <a href="archives/class htmls/ex8.html" target="_blank">example</a>.


~~~
<table class="table table-sm">
  ...
</table>
~~~
