## Part Two

### Font

Personalise your Theme by adding a font that you like. We will use "Montserrat" from Google's Font Library.

- Link to the font in the **&lt;head&gt;** section:
~~~
<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat" rel="stylesheet">
~~~

- Then you can use it in the page by modifying the **&lt;body&gt;** style as follows:
~~~
body {
  font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
~~~
You can find out more at: <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started?hl=en" target="_blank">Get Started with the Google Fonts API</a>

### Icon
Here, we will add an icon to the search button:

- Link to the icon in the **&lt;head&gt;** section:
~~~
  <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
~~~

Add the following to the link (Get Started Today) before the label:
~~~
<span class="fa fa-play"></span>
~~~
