# Rounded Corners & Thumbnails

You can use Bootstrap to render images with rounded corners or as a circle. This is achieved with the **.rounded-*** utility classes.

You can also use the **.img-thumbnail** class to give it a rounded 1 pixel border.

These classes can be seen in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex2.html" target = "_blank">example</a>.

  <img src="images/bird1.jpg" class="rounded" alt="Sample image">
  <img src="images/bird2.jpg" class="rounded-circle" alt="Sample image">
  <img src="images/bird3.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Sample image">
  <img src="images/bird4.jpg" class="rounded-top" alt="Sample image">
  <img src="images/bird1.jpg" class="rounded-bottom" alt="Sample image">

The utility classes can be applied to any element (not just images). The border radius classes are:

- rounded,
- rounded-top,
- rounded-right,
- rounded-bottom,
- rounded-left,
- rounded-circle, and
- rounded-0 (same as no rounded corners)
