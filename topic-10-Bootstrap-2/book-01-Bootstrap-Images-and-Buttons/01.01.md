# Responsive Images

Bootstrap provides classes that can be used when working with the **&lt;img&gt;** element.

Bootstrap provides the **.img-fluid** class to make an image scale appropriately across devices. 

This class applies **max-width: 100%** and **height: auto** to the image. 

This ensures that the image scales to the parent element
as seen in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex1.html" target = "_blank">example</a>.
