# autocomplete, autofocus, and multiple

## autocomplete

The **autocomplete** attribute specifies whether a form or input field should have **autocomplete** **on** or **off**. 
When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically completes values based on values that the user has entered before. 
It is possible to have autocomplete **on** for the form, and **off** for specific input fields, or vice versa.

## autofocus

The **autofocus** attribute is a boolean attribute. 
When present, it specifies that an **&lt;input&gt;** element should automatically get focus when the page loads.

## multiple
The **multiple** attribute is a boolean attribute. 
When present, it specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in the **&lt;input&gt;** element. 

**Note**:
The **multiple** attribute works with the following input types: *email*, and *file*.

- For **&lt;input type="file"&gt;**: to select multiple files, hold down the CTRL or SHIFT key while selecting.
- For **&lt;input type="email"&gt;**: separate each email with a comma, like: mail@example.com, mail2@example.com, mail3@example.com in the email field.
