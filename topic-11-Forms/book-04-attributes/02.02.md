# disabled, readonly, and placeholder

##disabled

The **disabled** attribute is a boolean attribute. 
When present, it specifies that the **&lt;input&gt;** element should be disabled. 
A disabled input element is unusable and un-clickable, and is not submitted along with the form.

## readonly

The **readonly** attribute is a boolean attribute. 
When present, it specifies that an **&lt;input&gt;** field is read-only. 
A read-only input field cannot be modified (however, a user can tab to it, highlight it, and copy the text from it), but is submitted along with the form.

## placeholder

The **placeholder** attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (e.g. placeholder="Jane Doe"). 
The hint is displayed in the input field when it is empty, and disappears when the field gets focus.
