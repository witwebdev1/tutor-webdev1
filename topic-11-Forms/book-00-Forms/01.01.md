# What is a Form?

HTML forms were the first technology that allowed a user to interact with the Web. 
Even today, they remain fundamental to achieving this interaction. Although the knowledge required to build a 
completely form-enabled Web site involves more than HTML. Here we will look at the HTML side of things.

The HTML **&lt;form&gt;** tag is used for declaring a form on a webpage. In the form block the user can fill any text fields, 
select any data from the drop down list control etc.. Once the user has selected/entered the data he/she wants, 
he/she can press the submit button and the data in the form is sent. Many things can be done with the data now. You can send the data to another page, which can process it. Usually these are server-side pages like asp, php, asp.net, cgi etc. that can do this. Or you could send the data via an email to somebody else.


The **&lt;form&gt;** tag is used in conjunction with form-associated elements. To create a form, you can nest 
form-associated elements inside the opening/closing **&lt;form&gt;** tags.
A form can be used as follows:

- to send some data to server
- to get some feedback from the reader
- to search something in the database
- and to do many other things.
