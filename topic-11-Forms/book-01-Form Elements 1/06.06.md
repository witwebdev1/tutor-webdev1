# Radio buttons

Radio buttons are similar to checkboxes, with the exception that when several radio buttons share the same name, 
only one of them can be checked. When the form is submitted, only the value of the selected radio button is sent. 
Radio buttons have a **type** of **radio**.

~~~
<label for = "email3">E-mail address: </label>
<input type="text" name="email3" id = "email3" size="20" >
<br><br>Please select which format you would like to receive our newsletter in:
<br><input style="float:left" type="radio" name="format" id = "text" value="text" checked="checked">
<label for = "text" style="float:left"> Text</label>
<br><input style="clear:left; float:left" type="radio" name="format" id = "html" value="html"/> <label for = "html" style="float:left"> HTML</label>
<br><input style="clear:left; float:left" type="radio" name="format" id = "pdf" value="pdf"/><label for = "pdf" style="float:left"> Adobe Acrobat</label>

The key difference between this and the checkbox example is that, in this case, we have three different options, 
yet the **name** attribute is the same for all three inputs. This is essential: it's this value that binds the three inputs together. 
They share the same name, but each has a different **value** attribute. As a user selects an option and submits the form, 
the appropriate value is sent to the server.
Note also that each input has a different **id**. In fact, any id that is assigned to an element in the document must be unique. 
It also benefits the label elements, which must refer to unique identifiers.

**Note**: The technique we use to preselect a radio button is also **checked="checked"**.
