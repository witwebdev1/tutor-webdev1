# Password Boxes

Password boxes are identical to text boxes, except for the fact that whatever the user types is not displayed in the control. 
Usually, asterisks or bullets are displayed in place of the characters. This type of control can be used to enter 
passwords and other sensitive information, however remember that although the text the user enters is invisible, 
it is not encrypted or protected in any other way. Passwords have a **type** of **password**.
