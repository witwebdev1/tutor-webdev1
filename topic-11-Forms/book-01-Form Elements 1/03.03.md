# Email Addresses, URLs and Telephone Numbers

## Email Addresses
The email input (**type="email"**) is used for entering either a single email address (or a list of email addresses).

If you attempt to submit a form with content unrecognisable as an email address, the browser will let you know that it is invalid.

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/form3.htm" target = "_blank">Email Address example</a>
~~~>
<label for = "user">Username: </label>
<input type="text" name="user" id="user" size="8">
<p>
<label for = "email">Email Address: </label>
<input type="email" name="email" id="email" >
</p>
<input type="submit" value="Submit Data" name = "Submit">
~~~

##URLs
The url input (**type = "url"**) is used for specifying a web address.

Again, if you attempt to submit a form with content unrecognisable as an URL address, the browser will let
you know that it is invalid. Only the general format of a URL is validated, so, for example, 
ht://example.xyz will be considered as valid, even though we know it is not valid. 
We will use the **pattern** attribute to specify a valid URL (later).

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/form4.htm" target = "_blank">URL example</a>
~~~
<h1>Form URL Example</h1>
<label for = "user">Username: </label>
<input type="text" name="user" id="user" size="8">
<p>
<label for = "url">My website is located at: </label>
<input type="url" name="url" id="url" ></p>
<input type="submit" value="Submit Data" name = "Submit">
~~~

## Telephone Numbers
The tel input (**type = "tel"**) is used for specifying telephone numbers. Unlike the *url* and *email* types, the *tel*
type does not enforce a particular syntax or pattern. Letters and numbers - indeed any characters other than new lines or 
carriage returns-are valid.
You can encourage a particular format by including a **placeholder** with the correct syntax, or a 
comment after the input with an example. Or, you may specify a **pattern**.
