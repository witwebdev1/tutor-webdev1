# Numbers and Ranges

## Numbers
The number input (**type = "number"**) provides an input for entering a number. Usually, this is a "spinner" box, 
where you can either enter a number or click on the up or down arrows to select a number.

<label for "quantity">I would like to receive
<input type = "number" name = "quantity" id = "quantity"> copies.</label>
~~~

The *number* input has **min** and **max** attributes to specify the minimum and maximum values allowed. 
You can also provide a **step** attribute, which determines the increment by which the number steps up or down when clicking the 
up and down arrows.

<label for "quantity">I would like to receive
<input type = "number" name = "quantity" id = "quantity" min = "2" max = "12" step = "2"> copies.</label>
~~~

**Note**: IE presently does not provide a spinner but implements the min, max, and step attributes.

##Ranges
The range input (**type = "range"**) displays a slider control. As with the number type, it allows the **min**, **max** and **step** 
attributes. The exact value of the number is not important with range. Ideally suited for customer surveys, etc...

Default value is the minimum value plus half of the maximum value.

<label for "rating">On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate Call of Duty: </label>
<input type = "range" name = "rating" id = "rating" min = "1" max = "10">
