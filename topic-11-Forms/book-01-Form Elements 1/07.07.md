# Select Element

The **select** element allows users choose from a range of options, but takes up just a single line on your web page; 
users view the options by clicking on the drop-down arrow.
The **select** element contains an array of **option** elements. Each option correlates to an option in the drop-down list.

~~~
<label for = "platform" >Please select an operating system:</label>
<select name="platform" id="platform">
<option value="win32">Windows 95, 98 or NT</option>
<option value="mac">Macintosh</option>
<option value="linux">Linux</option>
</select>

A select element which allows the user to select more than one option can be seen in the following
 <a href="archives/Class Htmls/form11.htm" target = "_blank">example</a>.

~~~
<label for = "product">Which products are you interested in?
<select name="product" id="product" multiple>
<option value="server" selected="selected">MORONS Server</option>
<option value="runtime" >MORONS Run-time Application</option>
<option value="devkit" selected="selected">MORONS Developer's Kit</option>
</select>
~~~

In the case of a menu with only one possible selected item, the control name will be taken from the select element's name 
attribute and the value from the value attribute of the option element that is selected. If there are multiple selections, 
then multiple name/value pairs are generated, all with the same name, but with different values.

**Note:** The technique we use to preselect a select element is **selected="selected"**.
