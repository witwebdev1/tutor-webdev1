# Inline Form

Use Bootstrap's **form-inline** class to make the form elements render as inline-block and left-aligned (single horizontal row). 
Use a spacer utility (eg, *mr-sm-2*) to add space between elements.

Controls only appear *inline* in viewports that are at least 576px wide to account for narrow viewports on mobile devices.

  <label class="sr-only" for="username">Username</label>
  <input type="text" class="form-control mb-2 mr-sm-2 mb-sm-0" id="username" placeholder="Username">

</form>

## Hidden Labels

Labels should always be provided on input fields, otherwise screenreaders will have trouble. You can hide the label if required, 
by using Bootstrap's **sr-only** class. This means the user cannot see the label but the screenreader can read it.

In the above examples, we use **sr-only** to hide the labels. We also add a **placeholder** attribute to provide a 
hint to the user as to what to enter.
