# Checkboxes and radio buttons

Default **checkboxes** and **radio buttons** are improved upon with the help of **form-check**, a single class for both input types 
that improves the layout and behavior of their HTML elements. 
Remember that checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting one option from many.

## Default (stacked)
By default, any number of checkboxes and radios that are immediate siblings will be vertically stacked and appropriately spaced 
with **form-check**.

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex5.html" target = "_blank">Example One</a> uses **form-check** with checkboxes, while 
<a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex6.html" target = "_blank">Example Two</a> uses **form-check** with radio buttons.

<form>
<div class="form-check">
  <label class="form-check-label">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" checked>
    Option one is this and that&mdash;be sure to include why it's great
  </label>
</div>
<div class="form-check">
  <label class="form-check-label">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" checked>
    Option two is another valid choice
  </label>
</div>
</form>

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex7.html" target = "_blank">Example Three</a> is a further example of laying out checkbox and radio button options. 

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/ex7a.html" target = "_blank">Example Four</a> is the same example as above but with the Submit* button moved in 
under the controls rather than the labels (using justify-content-end**).
