# Simple buttons

A simple button has a **type** of **button**, and displays the contents of the **value** attribute on the button face. 
Buttons have no default behaviour, but exist so that client-side scripts (such as those written in JavaScript) 
can use them to implement a user interface. 
If your browser processes JavaScript, the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/form16.htm" target = "_blank"> example</a> 
buttons should pop up alert windows saying "Hello!" and "Goodbye!"

~~~
<input type ="button"  value="Say Hello" onclick="javascript:alert('Hello!')">
<input type="button" value="Say Goodbye" onclick="javascript:alert('Goodbye!')">
~~~

There is also a **&lt;button&gt;** tag, which is used for creating a button control as in the following <a href="archives/Class Htmls/form17.htm" target = "_blank"> example</a>.

~~~
<button  onclick="javascript:alert('Hello!')">Say Hello</button>
<button  onclick="javascript:alert('Goodbye!')">Say Goodbye</button>
~~~
