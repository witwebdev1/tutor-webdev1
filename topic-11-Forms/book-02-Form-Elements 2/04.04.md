# The Textarea Element

Another element that is used to create form controls is the **textarea** element, which is very similar to an input element
with **type="text"**, with the exception that textarea elements define multi-line text boxes.

<a href="archives/Class Htmls/form14.htm" target = "_blank">Textarea example</a>

~~~
<textarea name="comments" id= "comments">
This is a text area with default rows of 2 and default columns of 20.
</textarea>
~~~

**Note**: You can specify the amount of rows and columns that you want in the textarea as in the following 
<a href="archives/Class Htmls/form15.htm" target = "_blank"> example</a>. You may also specify the maximum number of characters that the user is allowed to enter into the textarea control, using the **maxlength** attribute.

~~~
<textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows = "5" cols="40" >
This is a text area with 5 rows and 40
columns visible by default. The text
inside the element is its default value.
Although the control is limited in size,
the text entered can be larger than this
size, and the user agent will presumably
offer a scrolling mechanism for it.
</textarea>
