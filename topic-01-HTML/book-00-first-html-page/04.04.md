#Choosing a text editor 

There are several options when it comes to choosing a text editor, many of which make it easier to write your HTML code. It's up to you which one you choose - try out a few of the options that are installed on the PCs in the lab you are in now. Copy in the HTML that you have written so far and see how it looks.

- Brackets
- Notepad++
- Sublime Text

You can download and install any of these on your computer to try at home. 


##Save your work, often!

It is important to regularly save your work, this might seem obvious but everyone loses work at some point in the semester and you'd be surprised how many say "I just forgot to save it!"

In sublime if you go to close your files it will prompt you to see if you want to save your work, however better practice is to always save after first creating a new file so that you name it correctly and then as you edit your code you should continually save your work.
