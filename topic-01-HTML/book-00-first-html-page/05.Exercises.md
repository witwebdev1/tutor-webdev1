#Queries and Questions

There is a lot to take in and become familiar with while learning web development. You will always have questions, so please do ask your tutor; there is never a stupid question. 


For additional support you can use the Internet although there are so many sites the ones we recommend are:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference>
- <https://www.w3schools.com/html/>


#Exercise 1:

Explore this reference site here:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTML>

In particular, locate the `<tags`> you have used in this lab in the Element Reference section:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTML/Element

For example this is the `<p`> element:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTML/Element/p>

The text is very technical - but some of it will start to make sense over the next few weeks.

#Exercise 2:

At the end of this page:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTML/Element/p>

is a See Also section, which suggests two elements:

- `<hr`>
- `<br`>

Look up these in the reference, and try them out on the page you have designed.
