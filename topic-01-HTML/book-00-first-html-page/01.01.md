#Introduction Project

You will create a simple web page for it Starbuzz Coffee shop. They have made a name for itself as the fastest growing coffee shop around. If you’ve seen one on your local corner, look across the street—you’ll see another one. In fact, they’ve grown so quickly, they haven’t even managed to put up a web page yet…and therein lies your big break: By chance, while buying your Starbuzz Chai Tea, you run into
the Starbuzz CEO… who asks for your help...

These are the steps you will carry out:

To prepare we will create a folder structure to store our work.

If you are working on a PC in the IT lab, create a new folder on either your G drive/WIT OneDrive or on your usb drive and name the folder WebsiteDevelopment1. Inside that folder create another folder called Week01. You will be creating a new folder for each week this semester. Inside that folder, create a folder for this lab, called Lab00.

First on the list of tasks is to create a html file in a text editor. To start with, we're going to use the Notepad application. In a few steps, you'll get to choose a different text editor to work with; but for now, open Notepad.

In Notepad, choose New File from the File menu, and a new blank page should appear. When you open a new file you must tell Notepad what you want to name it. Click Save on the File menu and name the file index.html, save it into the Lab00 folder. Make sure you change the file type to 'All Files'.

Second on the list of tasks we type in the menu that the CEO provided to us on the napkin.

To do this we click on the index.html file we just created. In that page we type the following:

~~~

House Blend, $1.49
A smooth, mild blend of coffees from Mexico, Bolivia and Guatemala.

Mocha Cafe Latte, $2.35
Espresso, steamed mild and chocolate syrup.

Cappuccino, $1.89

Chai Tea, $1.85

Third on the list of tasks is to save the file. Click on the File menu in Notepad and choose Save.



Your file should look like this:
