##Add a table to events.html

- Last week, we created a table on the events.html page. Copy the HTML code from the events.html page you worked on last week to the events.html file in the testsite folder. Don't forget to also copy all of the CSS styles into the style.css file. 
- Once you have made these changes to events.html and style.css, use the 000webhost manager to upload these files again (into the appropriate locations).
- View your website to confirm that the table now appears.

##Add a gallery page to the website

- You will now add a whole new page to the Bubble Under website. This page should be called gallery.html. 
- The top section of the page should have the same contents as the other pages in the site - a H1 heading, paragraph with the tagline id applied, and the menu links. Don't forget to update the menu to include gallery.html! This should be done for every page in the site.

- After the menu links, add a H2 heading to the gallery.html page.
- Add a paragraph of text (it can be just a line or two - make up the text yourself!)
- Next, do an image search to find three images that relate to scuba diving. Create a subfolder in the testsite folder called 'images' and save the three images in there.
- Add the images to your webpage. If you need a reminder of how to do this, look back at Week 1  <a href="http://witwebdev1.github.io/webdev1/topic-01-HTML/book-02-adding-image/index.html" target="_blank">(HTML Basics, Adding an Image)</a>
- View gallery.html in your browser and check that everything looks as it should.

##Upload your changes to 000webhost

- Upload gallery.html and the other HTML pages to 000webhost 
- Create an images subfolder and upload your images there (remember the folder structure should mirror your own computer exactly).
- View the website by going to the web address (/testsite) and verify that the changes are reflected there.
