#View your website

Once you are finished uploading files, you can leave the File Manager area (just close the tab/window) and go back to the main 000webhost dashboard. 

You will see a link to your website in red text on this screen e.g. rosanne.000webhostapp.com. Click it to view your website.

We can click on the testsite folder to view our test website. Alternatively, we can go directly there in the browser by adding /testsite at the end of the web address e.g. rosanne.000webhostapp.com/testsite. 

You should now see your test website, which looks as follows:

Congratulations! You just deployed your first website. Now try the exercises in the next step, where you will add some extra content.
